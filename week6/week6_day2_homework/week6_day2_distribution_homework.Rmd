```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
library(skimr)
```


```{r}
clean_names <- read_csv("20190928-items.csv")
```

Q1 Load the data, clean_names() and explore it.
```{r}
view(clean_names)

```

```{r}
glimpse(clean_names)
```

```{r}
head(clean_names)
```

Q2. Find the brand with the highest numbers of phones in the dataset.
A. Samsung
```{r}
ggplot(clean_names) +
  aes(x = brand)+
  geom_bar(bins = 25, col = "white")
```

Q3. For your top brand, plot the distribution of phone ratings as a probability density, overlaying a fitted normal distribution. Do you think the normal distribution provides a good model of these ratings?

```{r}
clean_names_mean <- clean_names %>%
  filter(Position == "Samsung") %>%
  summarise(
    num = n(),
    mean = mean(count()),
    sd = sd(Count)
  )
clean_names_mean

```

```{r}
clean_names %>%
  select(-1) %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  skim()

```
